## General Information
- Simple static website to practice flex positioning and initial work on some media queries


## Technologies Used
- HTML 5
- CSS 3


## Project Status
Project is: _no longer being worked on_.


## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- Site needs a better layout specifically with layering the h1 and hero image. Grid would have been a better choice for the type of layout
- Media queries need some work. Did some basic research and it looks like they are positioned at the end of the styles doc. Organizing and laying out changes in the queries needs some work moving forward. Need to establish consistant break points.
